## Introduction
Perceptron algorithm for classification implemented from scratch using Python (pandas, numpy). Made to understand fundementals of how neural networks work. 

## What is a perceptron?
A perceptron is a simple mathematical model of a neuron. It is activated when the dot product of inputs and weights surpasses the threshold Î˜. 
It can be used as an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.
